                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                My names is Ebubekir Demirhan, I am {{ age }} years old and was born and raised in Vienna, Austria. <br>                Currently
                I am studying media computer science at the Technical University of Vienna.

                <br><br>I love playing video games and also want to be a game developer. I have no Projects or Work worth
                mentioning but I plan to change that.

                <br><br> Besides playing video games all day, I spent my time with browsing reddit, programming, watching
                videos, animes and movies and going out alone or with friends. I am not very athletic but enjoy playing ball
                sports.

                <h3>How I became interested in Game Development and Computer Science </h3>
                My two older brohters introduced me to gaming pretty early. The older one of them had a PlayStation and the middle one a
                GameBoy. And if they weren't playing I was allowed to. Later on we got a Computer and me and my middle brother
                played a MMORPG named Metin2 on it. As the days passed we spend more and more time playing and grinding in
                Metin2. After some time I stumbled upon a online board about Metin2.

                <br><br> The main sections on the board were about private Metin2 servers and cheats. I started to follow
                tutorials about running my own private Metin2 server over LogMeIn Hamachi, unpacking game files and modding
                the game. To be honest I didn't know exactly what I was doing besides following instructions but I sure had
                a lot of fun.

                <br><br>You needed a website where people could register for you private server, thus you would also find
                a lot of premade template websites there you could download and use after changing some variables. This was
                my first expierence with coding and webdesign.

                <br><br>I started teaching myself very basic HTML, CSS and later on basic PHP. I tasted blood, so most of
                my afternoons during middle school were spend this way. All of this was more of a hobby until I finished
                playing my first AAA video game on the PC, Assassin's Creed Revelations. It was the straw that broke the
                camels back and from that moment on I pursued my dream to become a Game Developer.
