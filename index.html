                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Ebu Demirhan, I am 25 years old and I was born and raised in Vienna, Austria. I have a passion for software development, traditional and digital art.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                My two older brohters introduced me to gaming pretty early. The older one of them had a PlayStation and
                the middle one a GameBoy. And if they weren't playing I was allowed to. Later on we got a Computer and me and my middle
                brother played a MMORPG named Metin2 on it. As the days passed we spend more and more time playing and grinding
                in Metin2. Video games have had a strong influence on my life: as a child, i spend a lot of my spare time with them and later my professional career were strongly influenced by my love for video games.</p>
